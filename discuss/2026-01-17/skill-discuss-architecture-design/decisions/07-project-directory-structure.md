# Project Directory Structure

**Decision Time**: #R9-R11  
**Status**: ✅ Confirmed  
**Related Outline**: [Back to Outline](../outline.md)

## 📋 Background

### Problem/Requirement
Need to organize the project directory structure for a multi-platform AI discussion Skill system.

Key questions:
1. How to organize code vs content (Skills are Markdown, not code)?
2. How to clearly separate Skills (Markdown instructions) from Hooks (automation scripts)?
3. Where to place platform-specific adaptations?

### Constraints
- **Skills are primarily Markdown** files (SKILL.md), not code
- Hooks are Python scripts for automation
- Need to support multiple platforms (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, etc.)
- Must be clear whether something relates to Skills or Hooks

---

## 🎯 Objective

Design a directory structure that:
- Clearly separates mechanism types (Skills vs Hooks)
- Makes it immediately obvious what each directory contains
- Supports multi-platform output
- Facilitates maintenance and iteration

---

## 📊 Solution Comparison

### Rejected: Functional Organization

```
❌ core/
    ├── coordinator/      # Mixing Skills and code logic
    ├── output/           # Unclear: is this Markdown or code?
    └── hooks/
```

**Problem**: Mixes functional concerns with mechanism types. Unclear at a glance what's Markdown (for AI) vs code (for automation).

### Chosen: Mechanism-Based Organization

```
✅ skills/                # 📝 Markdown files (AI instructions)
   hooks/                 # ⚡ Python scripts (automation)
   platforms/             # 🔌 Platform adaptations
```

**Advantage**: Immediately clear what each directory contains and its purpose.

## 📊 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Mechanism-Based Top-Level Directories

| Directory | Content Type | Purpose |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| `skills/` | Markdown | AI instructions for discussion facilitation |
| `hooks/` | Python | Automation scripts for procedural tasks |
| `platforms/` | Platform-specific | Handle platform differences only |

**Rationale**: Immediately clear what each directory contains.

### 2. Skills vs Hooks Separation

**Skills** (Markdown):
- Give instructions to AI
- Define "how to think" and "what to do"
- Natural language descriptions
- Platform-agnostic content

**Hooks** (Python):
- Automate mechanical tasks
- Execute at specific trigger points
- No intelligence, pure execution
- Platform-agnostic logic

### 3. Platform Adaptations

Platforms directory only handles:
- Header format differences
- Installation location differences
- Build/transform scripts

Core content stays in `skills/` and `hooks/`.

## 📊 Comparison with Previous Structure

| Aspect | Previous (Functional) | Current (Mechanism) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Top-level organization | By function (coordinator, output) | By mechanism (skills, hooks) |
| Clarity | Unclear if Markdown or code | Immediately obvious |
| Skill location | Mixed with code logic | Separate, clear |
| Hook location | Mixed with other concerns | Separate, clear |
| Platform handling | Unclear | Explicit `platforms/` |

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Confusion about Skill vs Hook scope | Low | Low | Clear documentation, examples |
| Platform adaptation complexity | Medium | Medium | Keep platform code minimal |
| Directory structure too rigid | Low | Medium | Revisit in V2 if needed |

## 🔄 Change Log

| Round | Date | Changes | Reason |
