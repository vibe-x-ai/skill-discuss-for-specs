| F3 | Update command | Medium | Version checking adds complexity; defer to later | Open |

| F5 | ~~Skill selection (install specific skills)~~ | ~~Medium~~ | ~~For now, install all skills together~~ | Closed (single Skill now) |

## Open Questions

Long-term questions to research or discuss:

| ID | Question | Context | Status |

| Q2 | How to handle platform version differences? | e.g., Cursor Beta vs Stable | Open |
| Q3 | ~~Should Skills be bundled into a single file or kept modular?~~ | ~~Trade-off between simplicity and flexibility~~ | Resolved (merged into single Skill) |
| Q4 | How to handle Skill updates for existing installations? | Need migration/update strategy | Open |
| Q5 | Should we add telemetry for usage analytics? | Helpful for understanding adoption, but privacy concerns | Open |
| Q6 | How to integrate with SDD tools (spec generators)? | Post-discussion flow needs integration guidance | NEW |
